            <h2>Origins and Early History</h2>
            <p>The Choctaw people have a long and rich history in the southeastern United States. Archaeological evidence suggests a continuous presence in the region for thousands of years. Their ancestors were part of the Mississippian culture, known for its mound-building and sophisticated agricultural practices. The Choctaw oral tradition tells of their emergence from Nanih Waiya, a sacred mound in present-day Mississippi.</p>

                    <strong>1830-1833:</strong> The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek (1830) leads to the forced removal of the majority of the Choctaw people to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). This journey is known as the "Trail of Tears."

                    <strong>Present Day:</strong> The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized sovereign nation with a thriving culture and government.
